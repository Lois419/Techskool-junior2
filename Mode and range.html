    <h1> MEASURE OF CENTERAL TENDENCY (Mode and Range)</h1>
    <div class="border-start-2 rounded ms-3 border-dark">
      <h2> Mode </h2>
      <p>
        The mode refers to the value that appears most frequently in a set of data. <br>
        To find the mode, you need to count how many times each value occurs in the data set and identify the value with the highest frequency. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say you have the following data set: 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 2, 6. <br>
        The number 2 appears 3 times, The number 3 appears 1 time, The number 4 appears 1 time, 
        The number 5 appears 1 time, and The number 6 appears 1 time. <br>
        In this example, the mode is 2 because it appears more often than any other number in the data set.
      </p>
    
    </div>

    <h2> Range </h2>
    <p>
        Range typically refers to the range of a set of data, which is the difference between the highest and lowest values in that set. 
        It indicates how spread out the data is.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's say you have the following data set: 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 2, 6. <br>
      The number 2 appears 3 times, The number 3 appears 1 time, The number 4 appears 1 time, 
      The number 5 appears 1 time, and The number 6 appears 1 time. <br>
      In this example, the mode is 2 because it appears more often than any other number in the data set.

        <h3>How to solve for range.</h3>

        <p>
          <li> <p class="fw-bold">Order the data:  </p>
            Arrange the numbers in ascending (smallest to largest) or descending order. </li>
        
          <li> <p class="fw-bold">Identify the highest and lowest values: 
        </p>Find the maximum and minimum values in the ordered data.  </li>
          <li> <p class="fw-bold">Calculate the difference:
        </p> Subtract the lowest value from the highest value.   </li>
           </p>


            

      


    <div class="border-start-2 rounded ms-3 border-dark">
      <h3>Lets Take An Example..</h3>
      <p>
       Find the range and mode of these numbers ( 10, 5, 12, 7, 15, 5. )
      <li> First of all, lets find the mode  i.e 5</li>  
      <li>That gives us 5  </li>    </p>
      <p><li> Now for the median we first of all, we would check for the highest number i.e 15 </li>
         <li> Now for the median we first of all, we would check for the lowest  number i.e 5 </li>
         <li>  Subtract the lowest value from the highest value. (15 - 5)</li>
         <li>That gives us 10  </li>
