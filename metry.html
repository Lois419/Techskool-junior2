  <div class="border-start-2 rounded ms-3 border-dark">
    <h2> What is geometry?</h2>
    <p> Geometry in mathematics focuses on foundational concepts like shapes, angles, lines, and their properties.
        They also explore concepts like perimeter, area, volume, and symmetry, and learn to solve geometric problems using measurement and calculations. 
    </p>

    <h2> Basic Geometric Concepts:</h2>
    <li> Points, Lines, and Planes: Understanding the fundamental building blocks of geometry. </li>
    <li> Angles: Identifying different types of angles (acute, obtuse, right, etc.) and their properties.  </li>
    <li> Lines and Line Segments: Differentiating between lines, line segments, and rays.  </li>
    <li> 2D Shapes: Recognizing and classifying various plane figures like squares, rectangles, triangles, circles, parallelograms, etc.  </li>
    <li> 3D Shapes: Identifying and describing common solid shapes like cubes, cuboids, cylinders, cones, and spheres.</li>
</div>

    <h2> Perimeter and Area of Some Plane Shapes </h2>
    <p> Most plane shapes have a perimeter (the total length of a shape) and area (the amount of two-dimensional space a shape or object occupies.) 
    <li> The perimeter  of a square is measured 2(L + B)  where l is length amd b is breadth <br>
        A square has equal length and breadth so you can as well multiply the length by 4.
    </li>
    <li> The perimeter  of a rectangle is measured 2(L + B)  where l is length amd b is breadth <br>
        So we multiply the length by 2 and the breadth by 2 and then add the products.
    </li>
    <li> The perimeter  of a circle is quite different (2 pi *r)  where pi is 3.14 amd r is radius <br>
        So we multiply the radius by 2 and then 3.14 and then estimate the result...
    </li>
   </p>
   <p>
   <li> The area  of a square is measured l*b  where l is length amd b is breadth <br>
    A square has equal length and breadth so you can as well  keep it as 4-squared. </li>
    <li> The area  of a rectangle is measured (L * B)  where l is length amd b is breadth <br>
        So we multiply the length by the breadth .
    </li>
    <li> The area  of a circle is quite different (pi * r^2 ) where pi is 3.14 amd r is radius <br>
        So we square the radius and then multiply by pi  and then estimate the result...
    </li>

     <h3>Lets take an Example..</h3>
     <p>Find the perimeter and area of the rectangle with a length of 5cm and a breadth of 2cm
    <li> To find the perimeter we use the formula 2(l+b) </li> 
    <li> Next we plug in the values l= 5 and b=2 </li> 
    <li> 2(5+2)= 7*2 = 14</li> 
    <li> To find the area we use the formula L * B </li> 
    <li> Next we plug in the values l= 5 and b=2 </li> 
    <li> 5*2 = 10</li>
