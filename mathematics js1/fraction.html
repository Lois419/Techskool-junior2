      <h2>Common Fractions</h2>
      <p>
        A fraction is a number which is represented by one integer – the numerator – divided by another integer – the denominator ( or the divisor). <br>
        Simply put, a fraction is a part of a whole number. It is not always possible to use whole numbers to describe parts of quantities. <br>
        It is therefore, important to know that to describe parts of quantities, fraction is used for example. <br>
        Simply put, a fraction is a part of a whole. For instance 9/11 means 9 parts out of 11.

      <h3>Types.</h3>

      <p>
        <h5>Proper Fractions : </h5>
         This is a common fraction having its numerator less than its denominator. Example

         4/7         3/5        2/5      
      </p>

      <p>
        <h5>Improper Fractions : </h5>

        <p>
            <h5>Mixed Fractions : </h5> 
        This type of fraction is in the form of an integer and a fraction. That is it has two parts.
        - a whole number, and 
      
        -  a fraction (usually a proper fraction) 
        
      Example is shown in the figure below

      <h3>Conversion of Mixed fracton to Improper fraction</h3>
      <p>
         Here, we multiply the denominator by the whole number  and then add the numerator <br>
          <li>  5 ½    =        

          11/2=  5 x 2 + 1 </li>

         <li> 3 2/5 =
            17 /5=  3 x 5 + 2  
        </li>

        <li>   10 1/3

                     = 10 x 3 + 1 = 31/3
                            </li>
