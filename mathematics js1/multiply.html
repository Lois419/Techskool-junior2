    <h1>Basic Operators( DIVISION AND MULTPLICATION)</h1>
    <div class="border-start-2 rounded ms-3 border-dark">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Multiplication of fractions is simply a direct method compared to
        division of fractions. In multiplication, there is direct multiplication
        of the numerator of one fraction with the other and the denominator with
        the other. Division is usually technical as there is reversal of the
        sign ( ÷) to multiplication sign 9x thereby leading to the reciprocal of
        the right-hand value.
      </p>

      <p> To divide a number simply means to share it also known as repeated subtraction. 
          if we were to divide the number 6 by 2, we would share 6 for 2 people i.e 3
          therefore, 6 ÷ 2 = 3... 
      </p>

      <p> To multiply two numbers, on the other hand, is a way to quickly add the same number multiple times. 
        It's like counting groups of things. For example, instead of adding 3 + 3 + 3 + 3,
         you can multiply 3 by 4 (3 x 4), which means 3 added together 4 times, resulting in 12. 
    </p>

    <p>One of the easiest ways to get around multiplication and division fast is the use of a times table. 
      So, it is reccomended that you learn your times table from 1-12

      <h2>BODMAS</h2>
      <p>
        When multiple signs are used during arithimetic operators, it is
        therefore important to apply some rules that will enable us know where
        to start from. Such guide is BODMAS. It states that when there is
        combination of signs, they should be taken in order of their arrangement

        <li>B= bracket</li>

        <li>O= of</li>

        <li>D= division</li>

        <li>M= multiplication</li>

        <li>A= addition</li>

        <li>S= subtraction.</li>
      </p>

        <h2> Problems involving BODMAS</h2>
        <p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Example: </p>Solve 10 + (5 x 2) - 12 ÷ 3
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution: </p>
          Brackets: Solve the expression inside the brackets first: 5 x 2 = 10. <br>
          The equation becomes: 10 + 10 - 12 ÷ 3 <br>
          Division: Perform the division: 12 ÷ 3 = 4. <br>
          The equation becomes: 10 + 10 - 4 <br>
          Addition and Subtraction: Now, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.  <br>
          10 + 10 = 20
          20 - 4 = 16   <br>
          Order of Operations – BODMAS Rule
          Therefore, the solution is 16.
