      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        L.C.M stands for Least Common Multiple and H.C.F stands for Highest
        Common Factor. <br />
        HCF is the greatest number that divides two or more numbers exactly. LCM
        is the smallest number that is exactly divisible by two or more numbers.

      <h2>Counting</h2>
      <p>
        HCF (Highest Common Factor) is the largest factor shared by two or more
        numbers.  Example: Factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.  Example:
        Factors of 1 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.  The common factors are 1, 2, 3, 6. 
        The HCF of 12 and 18 is 6. 
      </p>

      <p>
        LCM (Least Common Multiple) is the smallest multiple shared by two or
        more numbers.  Example: Multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.... 
        Example: Multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, ....  The common multiples
        are 12, 24, ....  The LCM of 4 and 6 is 12.

        <h2>What is prime factorization??</h2>
        <p class="fw-bold">
          Prime Factorization is a method to express a number as a product of
          its prime factors. <br />

          Lets factorize 30 using its prime numbers. <br />
          we will first of all divide 30 by its lowest prime number i.e 2.
          <br />
          The new number is 15.  15 is not divisible by 2, so try the next prime
          number, 3: 15 / 3=5 <br />

          The new number is 5.  <br />
          5 is not divisible by 3, so try the next prime number, 5: 5\ 5=1. 
          <br />
          Since the result is 1, stop.
