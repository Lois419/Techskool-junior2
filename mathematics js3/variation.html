      <h2>  INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>
        Variation refers to the relationships
         between two or more quantities where a change in one quantity results in a change in the other(s). <br>
         The main types of variation are direct, inverse, joint, Partial. </p>
        </div>
        <div  class="border-start-2 rounded ms-3 border-dark" >
      <p>
        <h2> Direct Variation:</h2>
        <li> When two quantities increase or decrease together at the same rate, they are in direct variation.   </li>
        <li> The relationship can be expressed as y = kx, where y and x are the variables, and k is the constant of variation. </li>
        <li> For example, if the cost of apples varies directly with the number of apples, then buying more apples means a higher total cost. </li>

          <h2> Indirect Variation:</h2>
          <li>When one quantity increases as the other decreases, they are in inverse variation.    </li>
          <li>The relationship can be expressed as y = k/x, where y and x are the variables, and k is the constant of variation.  </li>
          <li> For example, if the speed of a vehicle increases, the time it takes to travel a certain distance decreases, assuming distance is constant.  </li>

      </div>

        <p>
          <h2> Joint Variation:</h2>
          <li>Joint variation occurs when a quantity varies directly with the product of two or more other quantities    </li>
          <li>For example, if z varies jointly with x and y, the relationship can be expressed as z = kxy, where k is the constant of variation. </li>

            </p>
          </div> Partial Variation:</h2>
          <li>Partial variation is a combination of direct and constant variation.    </li>
          <li>It means a quantity varies directly with another quantity and also has a fixed value (constant).   </li>
          <li>For example, if y partly varies with x, the relationship can be expressed as y = kx + c, where k is the constant of variation and c is the constant value.   </li>

      <h3>Lets Take An Example..</h3>
      <p>
      Lets imagine we have a right angled triangle with an angle of 30 degree with the length of the hypotenuse of 20cm 
      Find the length of the opposite side
     </p>
      <li> Opposite = 20cm * sin 30 (0.5) </li>  
      <li> Opposite = 10 </li>    </p>
