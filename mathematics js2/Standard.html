      <p>
        Standard form, also known as scientific notation, 
        is used to express very large or very small numbers in a concise way. 
        A number in standard form is written as A × 10ⁿ,
         where A is a number between 1 and 10 (1 ≤ A < 10), and n is an integer (positive, negative, or zero). 

      <p>
        The concept of writing numbers in standard form, also known as scientific notation, 
        is attributed to the Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. It was created because some very large numbers could not be written without making mistakes.
        for example the number 0.000000000000003 might tend to cause confusion while transfering from one place to another.

    <h2>How to find express large numbers in standard form </h2>
 
    <p>
      <li>   Identify the first non-zero digit.</li>
      <li>     Place a decimal point after the first digit.  </li>
      <li>  Count the number of places the decimal point has moved from its original position. This count becomes the power of 10 (n). </li>
      <li>    If the decimal point moved to the left, the power is positive.</li>
      <li>
        If the decimal point moved to the right, the power is negative.
      </li>
      <li>    Example: 5,000,000 can be written as 5 x 10⁶. </li>

      <h3>Lets Take An Example..</h3>
      <p>
        Let us convert 56,000 and 0.000056 to standard form
     </p>
      <li> First of all, lets find the 56,000 </li>  
      <li>It gives us 5.6 * 10^4  </li>    </p>
      <p><li>First of all, lets find the 0.000056 </li>
         <li> It gives us 5.6 * 10^-5</li>
